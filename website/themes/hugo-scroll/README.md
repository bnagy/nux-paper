## üîë Installation
If you already have a Hugo site on your machine, you can simply add this theme via
```
git submodule add https://github.com/zjedi/hugo-scroll.git themes/hugo-scroll
```
Then, adjust the `config.toml` as detailed below & in the file comments.

### Playing around with our example site

If you simply want to check out the `exampleSite`, you can run
```
git clone https://github.com/zjedi/hugo-scroll.git hugo-scroll
cd hugo-scroll
hugo server --source=exampleSite --themesDir=../..
```

For more information, read the official [Hugo setup guide][hugo-setup-guide].

If you are starting fresh, simply copy over the contents of the `exampleSite`-directory included in this theme to your source directory. That should give you a good idea about how things work, and then you can go on from there to make the site your own.

Please check out the [config.toml](https://github.com/zjedi/hugo-scroll/blob/master/exampleSite/config.toml) included in the [exampleSite](https://github.com/zjedi/hugo-scroll/tree/master/exampleSite) of this theme.

You can add **a new section to the homepage** by running `hugo new homepage/my-new-content.md` (or craft the file manually)

To create **a page separate from the homepage**, run `hugo new my-new-page.md`


## üîß Feature details üî®

### Customizing CSS
Add a [`custom_head.html`](https://github.com/zjedi/hugo-scroll/blob/master/exampleSite/layouts/partials/custom_head.html) file to your `layouts/partials` directory. 
- You can use `<style>` tag to embed the overrides (better performance-wise)
- Alternatively you can `<link>` your own `custom.css`

`CSS` variables `var(--some-var-name)` from `assets\css\variables.scss` can be overridden by adding
```scss
:root {
  --some-var-name: blue!important;
}
```
### Icons
This theme includes the full set of [Fork Awesome 1.2.0 Icons][fork-awesome-icons]. Use the `{{<icon>}}`-[shortcode][hugo-shortcodes] with the respective "fa fa-ICONNAME"-`class` to use an icon directly in your `.markdown` files √† la
```markdown
Look at this nice ¬ªenvelope¬´-icon: `{{<icon class="fa fa-envelope">}}`. I took this from https://forkaweso.me/Fork-Awesome/icon/envelope/ :-)
```
### Header logo
Configured in `_index.md`, see `exampleSite`: `header_logo: "images/chef-hat.png"`

### Video cover
Set `header_use_video: true` in `/exampleSite/content/_index.md` and define video source via custom partial, such as `exampleSite/layouts/partials/custom_header_video.html`.

### Footer version information
In order to see technical version information (extracted from Hugo's [GitInfo](https://gohugo.io/variables/git/))) set the following general option in your config.toml: `enableGitInfo = true`

### External links
You can add an external link in the menu, see `external.md` in the `exampleSite`.

You can also use `extlink` shortcode to create a link opening in a new tab:
```markdown
Visit as at {{<extlink text="Instagram" href="https://www.instagram.com/yourInstagramName/">}}
```
Referencing and showing icons in front of the link text is possible with a new parameter `icon`:
```markdown
Visit as at {{<extlink icon="fa fa-instagram" text="Instagram" href="https://www.instagram.com/yourInstagramName/">}}
```
