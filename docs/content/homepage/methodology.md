The *Nux* is examined against the background of 'shorter Classical elegy'. This offers methodological reassurance since, if it produces sensible results for works with secure authorship then there is a *prima facie* expectation (but not a certainty) that the result for the *Nux* is reliable. The comparison corpus covers works in elegiac couplets by the key Augustan authors Ovid, Propertius, and Tibullus, as well as a few earlier works by Catullus. We use works which are at least 20 lines in length, but do not include the very long Ovidian works (*Ars*, *Fasti* ...)

A repeated theme in the results is that close attention was paid to a small group of ‘problem’ texts. These are elegiac works which may or may not be Ovidian. The intent is to demonstrate that, with the exception of the *Nux*, the analysis generally supports the scholarly status quo. In particular, the texts are the *Ibis*, the *Medicamina Faciei Femineae* (henceforth *Medicamina*) and the *Consolatio ad Liviam*. Because the texts differ greatly in length, they are broken into parts so that the analysis is always dealing with ‘poems’ of roughly the same size. For the *Ibis*, the first 62 lines (a proem, essentially) are separated and the rest is broken into three equal parts; for the *Consolatio* it is simply broken in thirds. The *Medicamina* and the *Nux* are shorter, and treated as single units.

For qualitative analysis, we examine both the lexico-grammatical style ("words") and the poetic style (metrical features, elision, assonance, ...) using unsupervised clustering. For quantitative analysis, we perform a bootstrapping method that statistically compares the style of the problem texts (in the same two domains) to the style of Ovid. These results are described below.
