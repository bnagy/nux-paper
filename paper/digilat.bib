    abstract = "Lemmatization of standard languages is concerned with (i) abstracting over morphological differences and (ii) resolving token-lemma ambiguities of inflected words in order to map them to a dictionary headword. In the present paper we aim to improve lemmatization performance on a set of non-standard historical languages in which the difficulty is increased by an additional aspect (iii): spelling variation due to lacking orthographic standards. We approach lemmatization as a string-transduction task with an Encoder-Decoder architecture which we enrich with sentence information using a hierarchical sentence encoder. We show significant improvements over the state-of-the-art by fine-tuning the sentence encodings to jointly optimize a bidirectional language model loss. Crucially, our architecture does not require POS or morphological annotations, which are not always available for historical corpora. Additionally, we also test the proposed model on a set of typologically diverse standard languages showing results on par or better than a model without fine-tuned sentence representations and previous state-of-the-art systems. Finally, to encourage future work on processing of non-standard varieties, we release the dataset of non-standard languages underlying the present study, which is based on openly accessible sources.",

              is sufficiently probable that quantitative scansion in Latin, imposed on a language in which accentuation by stress was alone significant originally, not only gave way to the earlier principle in the decline of Latin literature, but scarcely tended to suppress it at any time in common speech and in familiar writing. It is also probable therefore that even in literature dominated by quantity stress-accentuation was not obliterated altogether. In fact the incidences of it, in Vergilian verse at least, seemed so characteristic that in late Antiquity the Vergilian stress-rhythms were apparently copied without any knowledge of the prosody of the hexameter. In modern expositions, the variety of Vergil's rhythms is generally referred, not only to scansion, but also to stress-accentuation: and it has recently been shown that lines in which stress and metrical ictus predominantly coincide are different in quality and expressiveness from lines in which they do not. Since however no general explanation or definition of this difference in quality seemed to have been offered, I lately attempted a simple theory which would account for the different aesthetic values of lines of these two classes, and which would define, if possible, what these different values are.},

These tests are performed using two separate feature sets: a ‘‘raw’’ feature set containing all words and word bigrams that are common to all of the authors, and a second ‘‘pre-processed’’ feature set derived by reducing the raw feature set to include only words meeting a minimum relative frequency threshold. Each of the methods tested performed well, but nearest shrunken centroids and regularized discriminant analysis had the best overall performances with 0/70 cross-validation errors.},

The main concern of this task is to define an appropriate characterization of documents that captures the writing style of authors. This paper proposes a new method for authorship attribution supported on the idea that a proper identification of authors must consider both stylistic and topic features of texts. This method characterizes documents by a set of word sequences that combine functional and content words. The experimental results on poem classification demonstrated that this method outperforms most current state-of-the-art approaches, and that it is appropriate to handle the attribution of short documents.},

This sampling procedure, called the parametric bootstrap cross-ﬁtting method (PBCM; cf. Williams (J. R. Statist. Soc. B 32 (1970) 350; Biometrics 26 (1970) 23)), generates distributions of differences in goodness-of-ﬁt expected under each of the competing models. In the data informed version of the PBCM, the generating models have speciﬁc parameter values obtained by ﬁtting the experimental data under consideration. The data informed difference distributions can be compared to the observed difference in goodness-of-ﬁt to allow a quantiﬁcation of model adequacy. In the data uninformed version of the PBCM, the generating models have a relatively broad range of parameter values based on prior knowledge. Application of both the data informed and the data uninformed PBCM is illustrated with several examples.},

This study is concerned with developing intelligent methods which can be used to distinguish poem from prose. The goal is to distinguish and extract effective poetic features with which poems/lyrics can be accurately classified from other type of texts. In this paper, we propose five different approaches to poem classification. In each approach, we extracted a different set of poetic features and evaluated their performances against each other. In addition, we empirically assessed the effectiveness of traditional text classification methods for poem recognition and compared it with the proposed poetic features. While all of these approaches performed well, some showed superior results. Findings of this study suggest that the proposed features generate highly accurate classifiers, which can be used for poem mining in large databases such as World Wide Web. 1.},

For shorter texts of 500 words, the Arudbased measure outperformed the baseline of the 100 most frequent words, as measured by the Rand Index.

Burrows as a tool in authorship attribution problems, particularly in large ‘open’ problems in which conventional methods of attribution are not able to limit the claimants effectively. This paper tests Delta’s effectiveness and accuracy, and shows that it works nearly as well on prose as it does on poetry. It also shows that much larger numbers of frequent words are even more accurate than the 150 that Burrows tested. Automated methods that allow for tests on large numbers of differently selected words show that removing personal pronouns and words for which a single text supplies most of the occurrences greatly increases the accuracy of Delta tests. Further tests suggest that large changes in Delta and Delta z-scores from the likeliest to the second likeliest author typically characterize correct attributions, that differences in point of view among the texts are more signiﬁcant than differences in nationality, and that combining several texts for each author in the primary set reduces the effect of intra-author variability. Although Delta occasionally produces errors in attribution with characteristics that would normally lead to a great deal of conﬁdence, the results presented here conﬁrm its usefulness in the preliminary stages of authorship attribution problems.},

Since we are addressing this article to both stylometry experts and experts in the study of verse, we first introduce in detail the common classifiers used in contemporary stylometry (Burrows’ Delta, Argamon’s Quadratic Delta, Smith-Aldridge’s Cosine Delta, and the Support Vector Machine) and explain how they work via graphic examples. We then provide an evaluation of these classifiers’ performance when used with the versification features found in Czech, German, Spanish, and English poetry. We conclude that versification is a reasonable stylometric marker, the strength of which is comparable to the other markers traditionally used in stylometry (such as the frequencies of the most frequent words and the frequencies of the most frequent character n-grams).},

	abstract = {The question of minimal sample size is one of the most important issues in stylometry and nontraditional authorship attribution. In the last decade or so, a few studies concerning different aspects of scalability in stylometry have been published (Zhao and Zobel, 2005; Hirst and Feiguina, 2007; Stamatatos, 2008; Koppel et al., 2009; Mikros, 2009; Luyckx and Daelemans, 2011), but the question has not been answered comprehensively. In his recent study, Eder proposed a systematic approach to solve the problem in a series of experiments, claiming that a sample should have at least 5,000 running words to be attributable (Eder, 2015). The above studies (and many other as well) tacitly assume that there exists a certain amount of linguistic data that allows for reliable authorial recognition, and the real problem at stake is to determine that very value. However, one can assume that the authorial fingerprint is not distributed evenly in a collection of texts. Just the contrary, many experiments seem to suggest that the authorial voice is sometimes overshadowed by other signals, such as genre, gender, chronology, or translation. Some authors, say Chandler, should be easily attributable, while some other authors, say Virginia Woolf, will probably have their fingerprint somewhat hidden. Moreover, authorship attribution is ultimately a matter of context: telling apart Hemingway and Dickens will always be easier than distinguishing the Bronte sisters. On theoretical grounds, then, the minimal sample size can not be determined once and forever for the entire corpus, but may be different for different texts in the corpus.},

	abstract = {This thesis is a detailed commentary on the eighth book of Silius Italicus’ epic poem the Punica, lines 1-241. The text that is discussed includes the encounter, engineered by Juno, between Hannibal and the Italian nymph, Anna Perenna. The commentary follows the model of the Cambridge ‘Green and Yellow’ series and the notes mainly deal with philological and literary issues, especially those arising from the dense inter-textuality of lines 50-201 which draw heavily on Ovid’s Fasti 3. 523-656 and the Aeneid 4.393-692.
The commentary proper is prefaced by an introduction that considers: (1) the nature of classical commentary as a genre; (2) the significance of the selected text in the context of the poem as a whole; (3) the disputed authenticity of 8.144-223 (the so-called Aldine additamentum). In this third part of the introduction the metrical, stylistic and linguistic differences that exist between the text of the additamentum and the rest of Punica 8 are explored and analysed, and consideration is given to the likelihood of its authorship by an Italian Humanist. The text of the Punica used is the Teubner (1987) edition of Josef Delz.},

We analyze this by computing all possible skip-grams in a training corpus and measure how many adjacent (standard) n-grams these cover in test documents. We examine skip-gram modelling using one to four skips with various amount of training data and test against similar documents as well as documents generated from a machine translation system. In this paper we also determine the amount of extra training data required to achieve skip-gram coverage using standard adjacent tri-grams.},

Our bounds on the cumulative loss of the algorithms are relative to the smallest loss that can be attained by any ﬁxed hypothesis, and as such are applicable to both realizable and unrealizable settings. We demonstrate some of the merits of the proposed algorithms in a series of experiments with synthetic and real data sets.},

	title = {Authorship {Attribution} in {Fan}-{Fictional} {Texts} given variable length {Character} and {Word} {N}-{Grams}},
	abstract = {The task of authorship attribution (AA) requires text features to be represented according to rigorous experiments. In the current study, we aimed to develop three different n-gram models to identify authors of various fanﬁctional texts. Each of the three models was developed as a variable-length ngram model. We implemented both a standard character n-gram model (2 − 5 gram), a distorted character n-gram model (1 − 3 gram) and a word n-gram model (1−3 gram) to not only capture the syntactic features, but also the lexical features and content of a given text. Token weighting was performed through term-frequency inverse-document frequency (tf-idf) computation. For each of the three models, we implemented a linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) classiﬁer, and in the end applied a soft voting procedure to take the average of the classiﬁers’ results. Results showed, that among the three individual models, the standard character n-gram model performed best. However, the combination of all three classiﬁer’s predictions yielded the best results overall. To enhance computational efﬁciency, we computed dimensionality reduction using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) before ﬁtting the SVMs with training data. With a run time of approximately 180 seconds for all 20 problems, we achieved a macro F1-score of 70.5\% for the development corpus and a F1-score of 69\% for the competition’s test corpus, which signiﬁcantly outperformed the PAN 2019 baseline classiﬁer. Thus, we have shown that it is not a single feature representation that will yield accurate classiﬁcations, but rather the combination of various text representations that will depict an author’s writing style most thoroughly.},

	abstract = {Metrical patterning and rhyme are frequently employed in poetry but also in infant-directed speech, play, rites, and festive events. Drawing on four line-stanzas from nineteenth and twentieth German poetry that feature end rhyme and regular meter, the present study tested the hypothesis that meter and rhyme have an impact on aesthetic liking, emotional involvement, and affective valence attributions. Hypotheses that postulate such effects have been advocated ever since ancient rhetoric and poetics, yet they have barely been empirically tested. More recently, in the ﬁeld of cognitive poetics, these traditional assumptions have been readopted into a general cognitive framework. In the present experiment, we tested the inﬂuence of meter and rhyme as well as their interaction with lexicality in the aesthetic and emotional perception of poetry. Participants listened to stanzas that were systematically modiﬁed with regard to meter and rhyme and rated them. Both rhyme and regular meter led to enhanced aesthetic appreciation, higher intensity in processing, and more positively perceived and felt emotions, with the latter ﬁnding being mediated by lexicality. Together these ﬁndings clearly show that both features signiﬁcantly contribute to the aesthetic and emotional perception of poetry and thus conﬁrm assumptions about their impact put forward by cognitive poetics. The present results are explained within the theoretical framework of cognitive ﬂuency, which links structural features of poetry with aesthetic and emotional appraisal.},

@phdthesis{williams_relationship_2004,

	title = {The relationship between sound and content in {Latin} poetry},
	url = {https://digital.library.adelaide.edu.au/dspace/handle/2440/37945},
	abstract = {This dissertation examines the relationship between phonetic sound and content in Latin
poetry, with a focus on Books 1-3 of Horace's Odes. The central argument is that a
relationship exists between sound and content in poetry, that this can be analysed and
described more thoroughly and systematically than is usually the case, and that the
appreciation of poetry can be enhanced by doing so.
Part 1 presents a scheme for describing the sound-content relationship, and argues that this
accurately reflects the perceptions of poetic audiences and is psychologically valid. The
scheme begins with the concept of the 'sonance', defined as any set of sounds that renders
a passage sonically noteworthy. Sonances that relate to content are classified either as
'harmonic sonances', which relate to content due to the properties of the relevant sounds,
or 'repetitive sonances', which relate to content purely due to the repetition (including
patterning or contrasting) of sounds, regardless of their properties. Harmonic sonances, it
is argued, may relate to content through four 'harmonies', depending on whether acoustic
or articulatory properties are involved and whether the relationship is one of similarity
between property and content or a more distant 'metaphor'. Repetitive sonances may
relate to content by several different means, or 'modes of repetition'.
Part 2 presents a simple method of numerical analysis which may be applied to the text by
computer to extract passages that are relatively likely to contain a sonance, and briefly
discusses the process of assessing these results, identifying further sonances by more
natural means, and relating each sonance to the relevant content. As an essential
preliminary to such matters, Latin phonetics and phonology are also discussed in detail.
Parts 3 and 4 present the results of applying these resources of assessment and description
to the text, to demonstrate the type of poetic appreciation which may thus be gained.
Part 3 consists of two catalogues of harmonic and repetitive sonances taken from the whole
of Odes 1-3. Part 4 is a specific examination of two entire odes in much greater detail.},

The major representatives of the poetry of this epoch are Francisco de Quevedo and Luis de G{\textbackslash}'ongora y Argote. They are commonly classified by the literary experts in two different streams: Quevedo belongs to the Conceptismo and G{\textbackslash}'ongora to the Culteranismo. Besides, traditionally, even if Quevedo is considered the most representative of the Conceptismo, Lope de Vega is also considered to be, at least, closely related to this literary trend. In this paper, we use Topological Data Analysis techniques to provide a first approach to a metric distance between the literary style of these poets. As a consequence, we reach results that are under the literary experts' criteria, locating the literary style of Lope de Vega, closer to the one of Quevedo than to the one of G{\textbackslash}'ongora.},

	abstract = {The detection of allusive text reuse is particularly challenging due to the sparse evidence on which allusive references rely---commonly based on none or very few shared words. Arguably, lexical semantics can be resorted to since uncovering semantic relations between words has the potential to increase the support underlying the allusion and alleviate the lexical sparsity. A further obstacle is the lack of evaluation benchmark corpora, largely due to the highly interpretative character of the annotation process. In the present paper, we aim to elucidate the feasibility of automated allusion detection. We approach the matter from an Information Retrieval perspective in which referencing texts act as queries and referenced texts as relevant documents to be retrieved, and estimate the difficulty of benchmark corpus compilation by a novel inter-annotator agreement study on query segmentation. Furthermore, we investigate to what extent the integration of lexical semantic information derived from distributional models and ontologies can aid retrieving cases of allusive reuse. The results show that (i) despite low agreement scores, using manual queries considerably improves retrieval performance with respect to a windowing approach, and that (ii) retrieval performance can be moderately boosted with distributional semantics.},

Furthermore, UMAP has no computational restrictions on embedding dimension, making it viable as a general purpose dimension reduction technique for machine learning.},

	abstract = {Authorship attribution supported by statistical or computational methods has a long history starting from 19th century and marked by the seminal study of Mosteller and Wallace (1964) on the authorship of the disputed Federalist Papers. During the last decade, this scientific field has been developed substantially taking advantage of research advances in areas such as machine learning, information retrieval, and natural language processing. The plethora of available electronic texts (e.g., e-mail messages, online forum messages, blogs, source code, etc.) indicates a wide variety of applications of this technology provided it is able to handle short and noisy text from multiple candidate authors. In this paper, a survey of recent advances of the automated approaches to attributing authorship is presented examining their characteristics for both text representation and text classification. The focus of this survey is on computational requirements and settings rather than linguistic or literary issues. We also discuss evaluation methodologies and criteria for authorship attribution studies and list open questions that will attract future work in this area.},

Most of his long life was spent in the Roman civil service’. Then, after suggesting that the poet was seeking to make up for earlier missed opportunities by writing what is the longest surviving Latin epic, the potted biography concludes by declaring that his actual demise was in line with Stoic theory: ‘Silius met a bookish end…he starved himself to death.’While these remarks will not be left unchallenged, the very venom of the reaction to them is instructive. Scandalised, a reader of an earlier version of this paper thought that they should never be mentioned or at best buried in a footnote. After all, Wallace Stevens worked for a living too. No, show us that Silius is a good poet.},

We develop a method of scoring potential rhymes using a probabilistic model based on phoneme frequencies in rap lyrics. We use this scoring scheme to automatically identify internal and line-final rhymes in song lyrics and demonstrate the performance of this method compared to rules-based models. Higher level rhyme features are produced and used to compare rhyming styles in song lyrics from different genres, and for different rap artists. 1.},

	title = {Half rhymes in {Japanese} rap lyrics and knowledge of similarity},
	volume = {16},
	issn = {0925-8558},
	url = {http://www.jstor.org/stable/25702287},
	abstract = {Using data from a large-scale corpus, this paper establishes the claim that in Japanese rap rhymes, the degree of similarity of two consonants positively correlates with their likelihood of making a rhyme pair. For example, similar consonant pairs like \{m-n\}, \{t-s\}, and \{r-n\} frequently rhyme whereas dissimilar consonant pairs like \{m-∫\}, \{w-k\}, and \{n-p\} rarely do. The current study adds to a body of literature that suggests that similarity plays a fundamental role in half rhyme formation (A. Holtman, 1996, A generative theory of rhyme: An optimality approach, PhD dissertation. Utrecht Institute of Linguistics; R. Jakobson, 1960, Linguistics and poetics: Language in literature, Harvard University Press, Cambridge; D. Steriade, 2003, Knowledge of similarity and narrow lexical override, Proceedings of Berkeley Linguistics Society, 29, 583–598; A. Zwicky, 1976, This rock-and-roll has got to stop: Junior's head is hard as a rock. Proceedings of Chicago Linguistics Society, 12, 676–697). Furthermore, it is shown that Japanese speakers take acoustic details into account when they compose rap rhymes. This study thus supports the claim that speakers possess rich knowledge of psychoacoustic similarity (D. Steriade, 2001a, Directional asymmetries in place assimilation. In E. Hume, \& K. Johnson (Eds.), The role of speech perception in phonology (pp. 219–250). San Diego: Academic Press.; D. Steriade, 2001b, The phonology of perceptibility effects: The P-map and its consequences for constraint organization, ms., University of California, Los Angeles; D.

	abstract = {This study has four purposes: to provide a comparison of discrimination methods; to explore the problems presented by techniques based strongly on Bayes' theorem when they are used in a data analysis of large scale; to solve the authorship question of The Federalist papers; and to propose routine methods for solving other authorship problems. Word counts are the variables used for discrimination. Since the topic written about heavily influences the rate with which a word is used, care in selection of words is necessary. The filler words of the language such as an, of, and upon, and, more generally, articles, prepositions, and conjunctions provide fairly stable rates, whereas more meaningful words like war, executive, and legislature do not. After an investigation of the distribution of these counts, the authors execute an analysis employing the usual discriminant function and an analysis based on Bayesian methods. The conclusions about the authorship problem are that Madison rather than Hamilton wrote all 12 of the disputed papers. The findings about methods are presented in the closing section on conclusions. This report, summarizing and abbreviating a forthcoming monograph [8], gives some of the results but very little of their empirical and theoretical foundation. It treats two of the four main studies presented in the monograph, and none of the side studies.},
